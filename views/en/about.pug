        //-         div.about-text I am Simon Shlomo, the owner and consultant at <strong>"Dira Bulgarit - Israeli Real Estate in Bulgaria"</strong>.

        //-         div.about-text The main goal is to help Israeli investors find excellent real estate opportunities in Bulgaria. Currently, Bulgaria offers fantastic investment potential with properties that promise great returns. On the other hand, in the Israeli market, prices are high and returns are low. Bulgaria is one step away from full membership in the European Union and then real estate in the country full of breath taking landscapes will reach its true value - it's time to jump on the bandwagon.

                div.about-text Graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology and for the last five years been working in the field of programming and websites building. 
                div.about-text The difficulty in buying real estate at a reasonable price in our country leads many of the young couples and singles in their 20s, 30s and 40s to abandon their dream and accept the fact that they will probably not own property and will be forced to rent in an unstable market. The real estate market in Israel is going through many upheavals due to reasons such as lack of real estate supply, wars and lack of working hands in the construction market which makes the dream of purchasing a house almost impossible for many of us.
                div.about-text In recent years I have researched other real estate markets around the world to see if there are viable investment channels abroad and eventually I've ended up in Bulgaria. What attracted me especially to Bulgaria were the relatively low prices, the developing economy and the increase in investments in the country. I realized that this could be a great investment opportunity.
                //- div.about-text The Israeli channel where I found the most comprehensive information about investments in Bulgaria was in the Facebook group of Yeheli Samuels <strong>"Israeli Real Estate in Bulgaria"</strong>, and after a fruitful conversation with Yeheli, as well as with Simon Shlomo, a man with a lot of experience and many years In business development and consulting, we decided that it would be a good idea to launch a website that would include both worthwhile properties for investment and accessible information for Israelis who want to take the first steps in real estate investments in Bulgaria.
                div.about-text The purpose of the site we established <strong>"Dira Bulgarit - Israeli real estate in Bulgaria"</strong> is to surround the Israeli investor with close support throughout the entire process of purchasing the property - from the stage of interest and locating the property to signing the final contract and finding a tenant or moving to the desired apartment.
                div.about-text So if you are interested in investing in real estate in a country that has been in constant growth for the past thirty years, let me recommend Bulgaria as a worthwhile destination that will give you great returns for your investments. <strong>Contact us and schedule a video meeting at a time that is convenient for you and we will do everything we can to answer any question and accompany you to the desired property</strong>.
